Most holy Apostle, Saint Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus,
the Church honors and invokes you universally,
as the patron of hopeless cases, of things almost despaired of.
Pray for me, I am so helpless and alone.
Make use I implore you, of that particular privilege given to you,
to bring visible and speedy help where help is almost despaired of.
Come to my assistance in this great need
that I may receive the consolation and help of heaven
in all my necessities, tribulations, and sufferings,
particularly [here make your request]
and that I may praise God with you and all the elect forever.
I promise, O blessed Saint Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favor,
to always honor you as my special and powerful patron,
and to gratefully encourage devotion to you. Amen.
