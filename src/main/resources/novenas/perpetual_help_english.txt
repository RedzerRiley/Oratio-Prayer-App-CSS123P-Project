Mother of Perpetual Help, with the greatest confidence I come before you.
You are the refuge of sinners, the hope of the hopeless, the help of the helpless.
I entrust to your Immaculate Heart this special intention:
[State your intention]
Look upon me with compassion; do not abandon me.
Comfort my heart with the assurance that you will assist me.
Grant my request if it be the will of God and if it is good for my soul.
If what I ask is not God's will, pray that I may receive that which will be of greater benefit to my eternal salvation.
Mother of Perpetual Help, pray for me now and always. Amen.
