Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in You.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, I believe in Your love for me.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, Your kingdom come.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, I have asked You for many favors, but I earnestly implore this one.
Take it, place it in Your open Heart.
When the Eternal Father sees it covered with Your Precious Blood,
He will not refuse it.
It will no longer be my prayer, but Yours, O Jesus.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place my trust in You.
Let me never be confounded. Amen.
