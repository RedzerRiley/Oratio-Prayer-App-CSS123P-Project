Father in Heaven, I give you thanks for the graces and devotion that You gave to St. Carlo Acutis.

Through the merits of this Angel of Youth, grant me the grace which I earnestly seek (mention request hereâ€¦).

Amen.

Saint Carlo, you made the Holy Eucharist the focus of your life and devoted yourself to God in our modern times.

You engaged in the world but did not attach yourself to it.

Through your prayers obtain for me the graces from God to do the same, to be faithful always and lead others to Christ and His Holy Catholic Church.

I ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Concluding Prayer

Our Father
Hail Mary
Glory Be

Saint Carlo Acutis, pray for us!
