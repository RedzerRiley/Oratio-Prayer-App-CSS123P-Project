Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,

and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

angelus
The Angel of the Lord declared unto Mary,
And she conceived of the Holy Spirit.
Hail Mary...

Behold the handmaid of the Lord,
Be it done unto me according to thy word.
Hail Mary...

And the Word was made flesh,
And dwelt among us.
Hail Mary...

Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,
That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Let us pray:
Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts,
that we to whom the Incarnation of Christ Thy Son
was made known by the message of an Angel,
may by His Passion and Cross
be brought to the glory of His Resurrection.
Through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

divine_mercy
You expired, Jesus, but the source of life gushed forth for souls,
and the ocean of mercy opened up for the whole world.
O Fount of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy,
envelop the whole world and empty Yourself out upon us.

O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus
as a fountain of Mercy for us, I trust in You!
